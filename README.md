The company is phasing out its own data storage and has approached Accenture to leverage 
business and statistical approaches and devise an end-to-end Palantir-platform-based 
solution for data storage, impact analysis of price reduction (discount) on volume sales and
determining pricing strategies to maximize net revenue earned/gross margin/ROI in the USA
market in order to help business gain efficacy.

# Folder Description
## Case Study
It contains the detailed problem description and what is expected to be done
## Data
- Raw Data ( all the uploaded files)
- EDA Data 
  1. Merged Data (2 files Train merged &  test merged)
  2. Cleaned Data (2 files Train cleaned & Test cleaned)
  3. Feature Created Data(Train features, Test Features)
 - Modelling Data with prediction
   1. Train In-sample modelling Data (X and Y and Prediction)
   2. Train out of-sample modelling Data (X and Y and Prediction)
   3. Test modelling Data(X and Y and Prediction) 
   4. Final accuracy measure for all the modelling data
- Output Test data with prediction 
  Test data with ID and AMT_unit and Unit

## Solution-
     Algo-EDA Artifact
EDA Code as per b.ii.1/2/3 (separate for train and test)
EDA Visualization dashboard (Seasonality, Event impact, drill down to different brands, categories, impact of created features)
Modelling artifact
Code workbook for train models building and metrics
Code workbook for test and prediction 
Code workbook for discount strategy (managing all the errors that can occur in data, New product, never sold product, product sold long time back,â€¦..)
